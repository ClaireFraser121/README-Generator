# RapidREADME

  ## Description
  The rapidreadme is a command-line application designed to streamline the creation of professional README files for your GitHub projects. This intuitive tool prompts users for essential information about their projects, such as project title, description, installation instructions, usage details, and more. Using the Inquirer package, it dynamically generates a well-organized README.md file, following the best practices outlined in the Good README Guide. Key Features: User-Friendly Interface, Customizable Sections (Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions), License Badge Integration, GitHub Integration (Include your GitHub username for easy linking to your profile), Email Contact (Optionally provide your email address for users to reach out with additional questions). Spend less time on README formatting and more time on building remarkable projects with rapidreadme.
